                height of 9 stories and due to its architecture, the viewing experience is breathtaking. As new as this
                sounds,
                the apartment has dated back to the late 1950s and was originally built as dorms for the government for
                the
                Vietnam war, it wasn't till 2010 the residents of the apartment began to capitalize on the idea of
                building
                independent business within their homes.
